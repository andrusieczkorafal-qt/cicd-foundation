# Squish Custom Image for Cloud Workstations

The [CICD-Foundation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cicd-foundation)
[Blueprint for Cloud Workstations](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cicd-foundation/tree/main/infra/blueprints/workstations)
automates the deployment of
[Cloud Workstations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/overview)
using this custom image example for [Squish](https://www.qt.io/quality-assurance/squish).
It is designed for a self-service model where developers and testers can create their own
Cloud Workstation instances.

The **Squish Custom Image for Cloud Workstations** is a specialized image layer built on top of the [GNOME Workstation Blueprint](../gnome/README.md). It is designed to provide a highly productive, pre-configured desktop environment for Google Cloud Workstations, specifically tailored for advanced testing.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Foundation-First**: Seamlessly integrates with the [cicd-foundation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cicd-foundation) workstations blueprint.
- **Headless Excellence**: Leverages the base blueprint's headless Wayland and RDP/Guacamole stack for low-latency browser-based access.
- **Testing-Ready**: Includes the professional automated GUI testing framework for testing GUI apps.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This image uses a **multi-layered build strategy**:

1.  **Base Layer**: [GNOME Workstation](../gnome/Dockerfile) - Handles the core OS (Ubuntu 24.04), systemd, GNOME Shell 46, and remote access protocols.
2.  **Squish Layer**: [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) - Injects specialized post-build-time hooks (e.g., `01_install_squish.sh`), custom assets, and tools to layer on top of the foundation.

## 🛠️ Build Arguments

This image supports and propagates all base arguments, including:

| Argument                    | Default               | Description                                      |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `SQUISH_GCP_LICENSE_SECRET` | `squish-license-key`  | Name of the GCP Secret Manager secret used to retrieve the Squish license during image build. |
| `SQUISH_LICENSE_KEY`        | ``                    | Squish license key provided directly as a value (alternative to fetching it from GCP Secret Manager).              |

- **[System Overview](../../../docs/system_overview.md)**: High-level map of the entire Cloud Workstations Custom Image blueprint stack.
- **[Base Blueprint Docs](../gnome/docs/design.md)**: Deep-dives into the underlying systemd orchestrations and networking handover logic.
- **[Squish Doc](https://doc.qt.io/squish/)**: Official reference documentation for the Squish GUI test automation tool.

## 🔒 Secret manager
You can use GCP Secret Manager to supply the Squish license. By default, the secret is expected under the name `squish-license-key`, which is configured via the `SQUISH_GCP_LICENSE_SECRET` build argument. The secret value is fetched during the image build.

Make sure the Compute Engine default service account used during the build (`xxxxx-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`) has been granted the Secret Manager Secret Accessor role (read permission) on this secret — otherwise the build will fail to retrieve the license.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the CICD-Foundation**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cicd-foundation.git
    cd cicd-foundation/infra/blueprints/workstations
    ```
2.  **Configure**: Create a `terraform.tfvars` file such as:

    ```yml
    project_id = "YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID"

    # Squish Custom Image Build
    cws_custom_images = {
      "squish" : {
        git_repo = {
          url    = "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cicd-foundation.git"
          branch = "main"
        }
        build = {
          skaffold_path = "apps/workstations/squish/"
          machine_type  = "E2_HIGHCPU_32"
          # Pass environment variables to Skaffold to configure the Preflight UI source, Base Image or Squish license
          env = {
            CWS_BASE_IMAGE_TAG = "latest"
            GCP_REGION         = "us-central1"
            PREFLIGHT_WEB_REPO = "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cicd-foundation.git"
            PREFLIGHT_WEB_DIR  = "apps/workstations/preflight-web"
            # Name of the GCP Secret Manager secret containing the Squish license. Fetched at build time (alternative to SQUISH_LICENSE_KEY).
            # SQUISH_GCP_LICENSE_SECRET = "squish-license-key"
            # Squish license key provided directly as a value. Alternative to fetching it from GCP Secret Manager.
            # SQUISH_LICENSE_KEY = "<LICENSE_KEY>"
          }
        }
      }
    }

    # Workstation Cluster
    cws_clusters = {
      "workstations" = {
        network    = "workstations"
        region     = "us-central1"
        subnetwork = "primary"
      }
    }

    # Workstation Configuration
    cws_configs = {
      "custom" = {
        cws_cluster = "workstations"

        # Self-service: Grant permissions to a group or specific users to create their own instances
        #creators = ["group:developers@example.com"]

        # Reference the custom image defined above
        custom_image_names = ["squish"]

        # Best user experience: Keep >0 instance(s) ready in the pool for instant startup
        pool_size = 1

        # Hardware Specs
        machine_type                 = "e2-standard-8"
        enable_nested_virtualization = false
        persistent_disk_size_gb      = 500
        persistent_disk_type         = "pd-balanced"
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Deploy**:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```
